This is the F# community repository for the old F# PowerPack library. 
See http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/ for instructions on use.

The PowerPack functionality is moving.

 * F# CodeDom implementation(s) has moved to an [independent project](http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.CodeDom)

 * F# Parallel Sequences has moved to an [independent project](http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Collections.ParallelSeq)

 * F# Quotations Evaluator has moved to an [independent project](http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Quotations.Evaluator)

 * FsLex and FsYacc have moved to an [independent project](http://fsprojects.github.io/FsLexYacc/)

 * F# documentation generation is replaced by [FSharp.Formatting](http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/)

 * F# metadata reader is replaced by [FSharp.Compiler.Service](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/)

 * These components are replicated in [FSharpx](https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharpx):

   * Quotations to Expression Tree Bridge

   * Async extensions to WebClient, WebRequest and File

   * Lazy module

   * ResizeArray module

   * LazyList

These components are replicated in the F# support in [Math.Net Numerics](http://numerics.mathdotnet.com/):

 * Complex
 * BigRational
